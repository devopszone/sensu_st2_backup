Pull requests to expand API support are very welcome!\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Logs into Mattermost team server with username and password\n- Connects via websocket for real-time interaction\n- Can post messages to joined channels\n- Can be invited to channels / DMs since its just a regular user\n- Initiate DMs to users\n- Splits large messages in 4K chunks\n\n## Environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables may be defined to alter behavior:\n\n| Variable | Required | Description |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| MATTERMOST\\_TLS\\_VERIFY | No | (default: true) set to 'false' to allow connections when certs can not be verified (ex: self-signed, internal CA, ... - MITM risks) |\n| MATTERMOST\\_LOG\\_LEVEL | No | (default: info) set log level (also: debug, ...) |\n| MATTERMOST\\_USE\\_TLS | No | (default: true) set to 'false' to use http/ws instead of https/wss |\n\n## Mattermost 3.10\n\nThis client always tries to track the latest version of Mattermost.\nAs version `3.10` of Mattermost might introduce backwards incompatible API changes make sure you are using the latest version of this library.\n\n## Older versions of Mattermost\n\nFor interaction with Mattermost versions please use version of the library matching the Mattermost version\n\n# TODO\n\n- Write tests\n- Implement more API calls\n\n# License\n\nThe code is licensed under MIT\n",
